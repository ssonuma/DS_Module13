# Ex1(E) Stack Operations
## DATE: 01-03-2025
## AIM:
To write a C function to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion.

## Algorithm

1.Initialize top as -1 and declare stack as a character array.

2.To push, increment top and assign the character to stack[top].

3.To pop, check if top is -1 and return -1 if true.

4.If not, return stack[top] and decrement top.
  

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression
Developed by: SONU S 
RegisterNumber: 21222322107
char stack[100]; int top = -1; void push(char x)
{
stack[++top] = x;
}

char pop()
{
if(top == -1)
return -1; else
return stack[top--];
} 
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the C program to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion is implemented successfully.
